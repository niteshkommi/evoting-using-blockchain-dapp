# SECURE E-VOTING SYSTEM USING BLOCKCHAIN IN P2P NETWORK
The proposed model is a fully decentralized e-voting system based on blockchain technology. This protocol utilizes smart contract into the e-voting system to deal with security issues, accuracy and votersâ€™ privacy during the vote. The protocol results in a transparent, non-editable and independently verifiable procedure that discards all the intended fraudulent activities occurring during the election process by removing the least participation of the third party and enabling votersâ€™ right during the election. Both transparency and coercion are obtained at the same time.
